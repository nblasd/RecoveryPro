# RecoveryPro 📈

**Turn your trading journey around.**

RecoveryPro is a specialized money management assistant designed to help traders recover losses and achieve consistent daily targets using a mathematically calculated "Recovery Strategy".

## 💡 How It Recovers Your Losses

Trading is often emotional. When you lose a trade, the urge is to "revenge trade" with random amounts. RecoveryPro eliminates this by doing the math for you.

**The Logic:**
Instead of betting random amounts, RecoveryPro calculates the **exact** amount needed for your next trade to:
1.  **Recover** all previous losses in the current session.
2.  **Secure** your base profit target.

**The "Power of 1":**
You don't need to win every trade. You just need to win **one** trade within your chosen strategy limit (e.g., 1 win out of 5 trades).
*   If you lose, the tool increases the next investment slightly to cover the loss.
*   When you finally win that **one** trade, you clear all the previous "red" trades and bag a green session.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Smart Calculator**: Automatically adjusts trade size based on your payout percentage (default 92%).
*   **Dynamic Risk Strategy**: Choose your comfort level (e.g., "Win 1 out of 8" for safety, or "Win 1 out of 4" for aggressive small-capital growth).
*   **Capital Protection**: "Safe Suggestion" feature scans your total capital and warns you if your strategy is too risky.
*   **Goal Tracking**: Visual progress bar to your Daily Profit Target.
*   **Currency Support**: Native optimizations for **USD** ($) and **PKR** (Rs).

## ⚠️ Risk Warning

**Martingale strategies involve high risk.** While RecoveryPro helps manage the math, if you hit a losing streak longer than your strategy limit (e.g., losing 8 times in a row), substantial capital can be lost. Always trade with money you can afford to lose.
